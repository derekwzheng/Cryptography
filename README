This repository is a collection of my programs about crytography. The programs
are mainly written in Python and Java.

I have implemented the following crytosystems or functions:

1) Caesar cipher
2) XOR cipher
3) Enigma Machine (A simulator of the cipher machine created by German in WWII)
4) Simple RSA crytosystem
